# Automated Robot Assistant Foundation

This repository outlines the base structure for an automated robot that will mature into an AI assistant. The layout separates hardware integration, perception, decision-making, control, and human-facing interaction, allowing each capability to evolve independently while remaining cohesive.

```

### Getting Started

1. Extend `docs/architecture.md` with platform-specific requirements.
2. Implement hardware stubs in `src/robot_assistant/hardware` to model actuators and sensors.
3. Evolve the runtime loop in `src/robot_assistant/runtime/system.py` to coordinate perception, planning, and control.

### Next Steps

- Add simulation tooling to validate controllers without physical hardware.
- Introduce persistent storage and state logging for diagnostics.
- Integrate policy learning modules once the deterministic pipeline is stable.
